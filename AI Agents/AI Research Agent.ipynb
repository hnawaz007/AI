      "content=\"LangChain is a popular open-source framework designed to help developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Here are its key aspects:\\n\\n1. Main Purpose:\\n- Simplifies the process of creating LLM-powered applications\\n- Enables the connection of LLMs with external data sources and environments\\n- Provides tools for creating chains of operations with LLMs\\n\\n2. Key Features:\\n- Chains: Combine multiple operations into sequential workflows\\n- Agents: Create autonomous AI systems that can plan and execute tasks\\n- Memory: Maintain conversation history and context\\n- Prompts: Manage and optimize prompts for LLMs\\n- Document loaders: Import various document types\\n- Vector stores: Enable efficient similarity search\\n\\n3. Common Use Cases:\\n- Question-answering systems\\n- Chatbots\\n- Document analysis\\n- Text summarization\\n- Code analysis\\n- Data extraction\\n\\n4. Supported LLMs:\\n- OpenAI (GPT models)\\n- Google's PaLM\\n- Hugging Face models\\n- And many others\\n\\n5. Benefits:\\n- Modular and flexible architecture\\n- Language support for Python and JavaScript\\n- Rich ecosystem of integrations\\n- Active community and development\\n\\nLangChain has become increasingly popular for building complex AI applications as it provides a structured way to work with LLMs and combine them with other tools and services.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'id': 'msg_019XpErtj7aBQkGgj6kQUCHV', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 310, 'server_tool_use': None, 'service_tier': 'standard'}, 'model_name': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'} id='run--f8b5aa87-861b-40a3-884b-07aae71b85c9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 310, 'total_tokens': 322, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0, 'cache_creation': 0}}\n"
